2018/12/27 - v1.2.4

Maintenance modifications by PTeam staff:

- The script was failing when not all channels were selected; see bug report:
      https://pixinsight.com/forum/index.php?topic=13050.0

- The script was using an obsolete way to measure execution time. It has been
  replaced with much simpler code based on the ElapsedTime core PJSR object.

- ### TODO: This script requires a complete code revision.
