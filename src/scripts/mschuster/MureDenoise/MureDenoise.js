#feature-info <b>MureDenoise Version 1.16</b><br/>\
   <br/>\
   Script for denoising linear monochannel images corrupted by mixed \
   Poisson-Gaussian noise. Applicable to single frame images and average \
   combinations of equally exposed and registered frames.<br/>\
   <br/>\
   The script supports an astronomical image processing workflow in which \
   the denoising step occurs immediately after the calibration and optional \
   average combination steps and prior to other linear or nonlinear \
   processing steps.<br/>\
   <br/>\
   The script applies an interscale wavelet mixed noise unbiased risk \
   estimator (MURE) to find a denoised output image that minimizes an \
   estimate of the oracle mean-squared error (MSE), or &quot;risk&quot;, \
   between the denoised output image and the unknown noise-free image.<br/>\
   <br/>\
   <b>Note</b>: For linear multichannel images from monocolor detectors, run \
   the monochannel denoiser on each channel separately. The script does not \
   work properly for images from one shot color (OSC) detectors.<br/>\
   <br/>\
   <b>Warning</b>: The script is adapted to denoise linear monochannel images \
   mainly corrupted by shot noise, read noise, and dark current noise which \
   is typically the case for astronomical data. The script does not work \
   properly for other noise distributions, for saturated images, for \
   debayered images, for linearly or nonlinearly processed images, for \
   median combinations, or for drizzle combinations.<br/>\
   <br/>\
   <b>Warning</b>: Do not combine denoised images. Signal-to-noise ratio \
   (SNR) will be enhanced by combining noisy images and denoising the \
   result. Combined images must be equally exposed, have the same pixel \
   resolution, and be registered by projective transformation with no \
   distortion correction.<br/>\
